A* Solver

Files:
+ AStarSolver.cs
+ IAStarNode.cs

This is an implementation of the A* algorithm. I had implemented this algorithm for solving sokoban mazes but generalized the source code so it may be used for game development purposes. Look for my repositories (https://github.com/dendriel/move-box-solver) so you can check out AStarSolver in action.
